# NOTES - the surf_princessburglar_b26 lineage

The lineage's memory: every round's winner appends what it learned (what worked, what did not,
the numbers). Read it before you start; append to it before you wrap up.

## The map (operator, 2026-10-23, measured before round 1)

* The surf community calls it THE hardest map. ~7.7k x 7.7k x 7.5k units; the course falls
  ~7,100 u from the top to a finish box at the bottom (x 560-880, y 2608-2928, z -3509..-3474).
* The spawn (511, 413, 2888) is in a SEALED start room (11% of free space) whose only exit is
  the trigger_teleport `start_run`. Every teleport is fatal in our core, so the zones file
  (source manual) declares the spawn at its destination, (860, -3005, 3653) yaw 0. 30
  teleports go to `start` (fall catches back to the room), one to `tlp_end` (the end room, just
  after the finish), one to `burgir` (a bonus room off the course). All stay fatal.
* Goal field (no-corner-cut, cell 32): 507,547 reachable voxels, start d 57,149 u (54,367 u on
  the corner-cutting field). The course is one free-space component (83% of free space).
* Physics: the WR server's movevars are our defaults except sv_maxvelocity 3500 (the recipe
  carries --maxvel 3500; sidistic trained at 4000).
* WR demo (ANALYSIS ONLY, never training - CLAUDE.md section 0; parsed copy in
  $AR_HOME/incumbent/wr/): 77.5 s of playback at 7.62 ms frames (131 fps; we train at 10 ms),
  start curtain and start_run at 0.25 s, finish at 75.44 s = **75.18 s** zone to zone; max
  speed ~2,760 u/s per frame. It is a yardstick and a route instrument (BEV / where the policy
  dies), never a spawn source, a line, a reward or a BC target.

## Where the recipe comes from: the sidistic lineage (7 rounds, 2026-10-20..23)

Round winners there: 28.6 / 28.8 / 54.7 / 94.7 / 98.3 / 98.3 / 107.2 (the first greedy finish
from the true start, 118.05 s). `config.incumbent_recipe` is its finishing run's flag set, from
scratch. What each part did ON SIDISTIC (constants were set there, several late in a long line):

* `--race-ratchet` + `--respawn-novel` (R1): pay only new progress records; spawn own reservoir
  states moved into unvisited cells. Together they crossed the first dip gates from scratch.
* novel-spawn options `--respawn-novel-band/turn/shell/radius/frac` (R2, R4): put the moved
  states in the dips behind the frontier; band 0.15 after a lucky episode lifted the ceiling.
* `--time-pen 0.001`, `--surf-bonus 0` (R3, R6): at 0.005 dying beat every slow dip detour.
* `--respawn-greedy 0.25 --respawn-greedy-window 0.25 2 --respawn-greedy-stuck 200` (R3, R4): own
  greedy-eval states from just before each greedy death; the reservoir had <1% there.
* `--stall-eps 5` (R4): the race stall rule runs per TICK; 32 u/tick killed 30-50% of training
  episodes (a correction of a per-tick constant, not a tuning).
* `--eval-patience 30 --eval-parallel 1` (R4): evals were half the wall clock.
* `--unstuck-temp-heads keys`, `--unstuck-max 0.2` (R4, R5): exploration temperature on the key
  heads only; the low cap kept a long greedy line intact. FROM SCRATCH on sidistic the early
  gates were crossed with the cap at 2 ("temperature discovers, the death charge keeps").
* `--race-no-corner-cut 1` (R5): the 26-neighbour field leaked through slanted one-voxel walls.
* `--pitch-sigma-min 0.05` (R4, R5, found three times): the camera-only pitch head sat on the
  sigma floor and carried ~95% of every update's KL.
* `--respawn-front-perturb ...`, `--respawn-backward-mix 0.1`, `--front-temp 1 --front-band 0.01`
  (R6): own frontier-band states with the heading turned and speed scaled; goal-anchored rows.
* `--energy-pot 3 --energy-pot-front 0.01 --energy-pot-front-bonus 1` (R7): potential shaping on
  the energy height z + |v|^2/2g, priced only up to the frontier band (paid once at its edge).
  The last sidistic gate was an energy deficit through a U-turn; +300 u of energy into it.
* `--respawn-backward-elev -60 60` (R7): the goal-anchored rows had been clamped to a +30 deg
  climb; allowed to climb, real training finishes rose ~10x and the greedy line finished.
* Learning-rate cuts (1e-4, then 5e-5) on the peak weights reproduced the finishes (R7): the
  finishing skill appeared at a transient peak and drifted away at 3e-4.

Ideas that LOST their rounds there and are not in the recipe (worth knowing, not instructions):
`--race-kill-aware 1` (a field that routes around kill volumes; 54.7 -> 68.3 in R4), `--respawn-front`
(rows from the 2 s before real episodes reach the frontier; the first real training finish, R6),
`--fail-pen 10` (a death charge, R3). Nulls there: `--speed-pot` (harmful, twice), SIL variants,
`--respawn-greedy-speed` on all rows, frontier temperature at a wall.

## After the program (operator, local): search and distil

The policy-guided population search `tools/beam_tas.py` (now mirroring the compass / ratchet /
surf / pot-rate blocks) turned sidistic's non-finishing snapshot into finishing lines from the
true start in a minute per wave, and three rounds of `tools/exit_local.py` (search -> distil into
BC rows with `tools/plan_to_bc.py` -> train -> gate) took the best line from 118 s to 113.8 s
from spawn. What mattered: rank by distance early and by the policy's own critic near the end
(`--score dv`; distance-only ranking collapsed onto the policy's line and stalled), 4096 envs,
resample every 25 decisions. On a box it runs as it does locally (CPU physics + the GPU).

## Open questions for this map (not instructions)

* Does the recipe, built late on one long sidistic line, explore well from scratch here?
* Is the sidistic finisher's weight a useful warm start ($AR_HOME/incumbent/sid_ref/ckpt.pt)?
* Where does the field disagree with the way through (dips, U-turns, kill volumes)?

## Round log

(winners append below)

## pbr1b1 (round 1, slot 1) - 2026-10-23 14:50 UTC

Box: 57382830, RTX 5080 + i9-14900 (32 thr, cgroup quota 30.7 CPUs), 0.561 $/h, Italy.
The trainer saturates the CPU quota (3,100% CPU), ~250k steps/s steady after warm-up;
a second concurrent trainer would not add throughput.

### Baseline: the incumbent recipe from scratch is stuck AT THE START (pbr1b1_base)
`config.incumbent_recipe` from scratch, stopped at 290M (of 4e8) because it was flat:
greedy evals 0.1 / 0.4 / 0.4 / 0.1 % (score 0.417 at 151M), best progress record 111 u
for 280M steps, reservoir deepest 1.7% at 282M (creeping via front-perturb rows), unstuck T
at its 0.2 cap, view sigma at its 2.718 cap. Every greedy episode dies or is patience-cut
inside the start room (x 650..1130, y -3155..-3100, z 3650..3690).

### Why (analysis of the map + the WR demo, ANALYSIS ONLY)
* Along the record's route the no-corner-cut field is almost perfectly monotone EXCEPT the
  start: the record first goes EAST, away from the goal, for ~6 s (d rises 1,520 u =
  2.7% of d0: 57,149 -> 58,664 at x 2,333), surfing a half-pipe down to z 3,370 and back up,
  gaining ~230-280 u of energy height (z + |v|^2/2g: 3,653 at spawn -> ~3,930), then flies
  back west at z ~3,720-3,760 (60-110 u ABOVE the spawn floor level) at ~500-600 u/s
  through a passage north of the spawn (y ~ -2,885), and from there d falls monotonically
  (the only other rise on the whole route is 199 u at 20%).
* So the start is a speed/height gate: the way on is ~70-110 u above the spawn and the only
  way up is energy built in the east half-pipe. Directly west of the spawn there is a
  push-down trigger (2,500 u/s) + conveyor doorway at x 648..718, y -3054..-2946, and walls.
  A trigger_teleport (fatal) sits just above the spawn area (z 3,696..3,780 AABB), so
  jumping near the spawn kills: the 227M eval died 9/9 at 1.2-1.7 s jumping.
* The field-follower goes west into the corner at (650, -3155, 3652) and stays there;
  the sidistic finisher's weights zero-shot do exactly the same (local CPU recording:
  0.3%, stuck jumping in that corner for 80 s).

### The start gate in OUR core, probed (2026-10-23 ~15:00 UTC, analysis tools only)
* The only way out of the start room is a CROUCH TUNNEL heading west at y ~ -2,885, floor
  ~3,703 (87 u above the spawn floor), x ~800 -> ~90; a standing hull is stuck in it
  (stuck_ticks -> fail), a ducked hull flies/slides through. The record ducks for ~1 s there.
* The shaping field cannot see it: `goal_occupancy` is the slab grid at 32 u, and every
  tunnel voxel (z 3,717-3,749) is slab-solid (point-hull free) -> unreachable. 126,935 such
  "point-free, slab-solid" voxels on this map. The field instead descends from the spawn into
  a passage on the SOUTH side (y ~ -3,096, z ~3,733) that is crouch-height too and sits over
  kill volume *127 - a dead end. Every PPO greedy episode ends at its mouth (650, -3,100, 3,690).
* A standing hull crossing x 862..878 at z ~3,745 (the record's own line, rows 666-669) is
  inside trigger_teleport *257 in our core; ducked it survives. So the record's exact line
  dies here unless it ducks ~0.1 s earlier - the gate is a crouch puzzle more than a speed one.

### Go-Explore phase 1 solves the start gate by itself in ~1 minute (pbr1b1_ge1)
`tools/explore_phase1.py --cell 64 --cell-speed 8 --cell-speed-max 2400 --decisions 100
--act-every 4 --envs 2048` on the box from the TRUE spawn (reward-free, uniform random actions,
95% repeat, cells chosen 1/sqrt(seen+1)): 2.2M ticks/s, 3,597 cells in 4.4 min. Its deepest
chain: spawn -> a DUCK-JUMP north-west onto the tunnel mouth (t ~0.2-1 s) -> west through the
tunnel at 200-300 u/s -> drops out at x ~90 -> slides down to the floor at z ~3,332 ->
(827, -3,312, 3,367) = 3.19% on the grader's field (PPO's best: 0.42%). Then it plateaus: the
next section needs surf skill that uniform random actions do not have (cannonball's 6.67%
freeze, same cause). Archive: $AR_HOME/runs/pbr1b1/_ge1/ (archive.npz, ge1_states.npy as
STATE_DTYPE rows, md5 1b1fa36b115e2e5112f229b5caaa2bc3): 2,197 cells at negative progress (the
east half-pipe), ~1,000 past 1%, 62 inside the tunnel.
So the start is an exploration gate PPO's narrow policy never samples (it learned "jump near
the spawn = death": trigger *257 hangs over the ledge east of the spawn), and an archive of
return-then-explore with uniform actions crosses it at once. Section 0/0b: the archive is our
own reward-free search from the true spawn, no demo or record data, generic constants.

### Warm sidistic weights + the GE archive as spawns (pbr1b1_gewarm, gewarm2)
* `pbr1b1_gewarm` (resume of the stripped sidistic finisher, recipe flags from its config,
  `--spawn-states ge1_states.npy --spawn-states-frac 0.3`): the 76M greedy eval ran EAST from
  the true spawn into the half-pipe and died there (9/9, z ~3,290-3,310): 61% of the archive
  is that dead-end half-pipe (behind the start on the field), and a uniform draw taught it.
  Stopped at 78M.
* Fix (generic): keep only archive cells the shaping field ranks DEEPER than the true start
  (d < d_start): 1,058 of 3,597 (70 within 150 u of the spawn, 53 in the tunnel, the rest past
  it). `pbr1b1_gewarm2` = the same launch on that file (ge1_fwd_states.npy,
  md5 6897f4c420346e07a2b35ad18a719c36).
* Trainer flag `--ge-minutes M [--ge-frac 0.3 --ge-cell 64 --ge-speed 8]` (default off,
  bit-identical, TRAIN_ONLY in record_ckpt): runs explore_phase1 from the true spawn for M
  minutes on all CPUs before training (it exits 1 when nothing finished - accepted), writes
  runs/<run>/ge_states.npy (reused on resume), applies the same deeper-than-the-start filter on
  the shaping field, and mixes it into every training spawn pool as --ge-frac (the
  --spawn-states rule; no SELF_STATES needed: it is the run's own search, never data).
  explore_phase1 gained `--maxvel` (its core defaulted to 2000; the recipe runs 3500).
  Tests: tests/python/test_ge_minutes.py (CPU, princessburglar).

### Gate 2 is ENERGY: the pit after the tunnel drop (measured 2026-10-23 15:30 UTC)
* Past the tunnel the route drops into a pit (floor z ~3,330-3,340 at x ~650-900) and must climb
  out (the record: a U-turn east -> north -> west up to z ~3,500-3,530 at ~700-750 u/s, then a
  long drop west). The record arrives with energy height h = z + |v|^2/2g ~3,850-3,970 (it
  pumped the east half-pipe first: h 3,653 at spawn -> ~3,930). Go-Explore's states past 2%
  have h <= ~3,600-3,667 - the uniform-action search crawls through the tunnel at 200-300 u/s.
* `explore_phase1 --cell-energy 32` (6 threads, 6.6 min, rooted at the spawn, ge2 archive in
  $AR_HOME/runs/pbr1b1/_ge2/): 12,561 cells, half-pipe h max 3,802 (vs 3,775 without energy
  cells), pit h max ~3,600-3,667, frontier unchanged at 3.2%. Random actions do not generate the
  ~200+ u of energy; the policy's own surfing has to (or the climb needs less than I think).
* PPO's training frontier (reservoir min-depth 96.76%) has not moved past the archive's 3.2% in
  220M steps of gewarm2 either.
* Merged forward spawn file of both archives: _ge2/ge12_fwd_states.npy (4,038 states, h median
  3,582, max 3,859; md5 f93b2d0b6e45e96c044c9e56e3382ace).

### The start gate, corrected (2026-10-23 ~15:50 UTC, core traces)
* pbr1b1_gewarm2 (400M, stopped at budget): greedy evals 0.414 / 0.418 / 0.421 / 0.440 / 0.432 /
  0.451 (best, 378M). From 76M on, EVERY greedy episode ends at the tunnel MOUTH (x ~649-681,
  y ~-2880..-2930, on the spawn floor) instead of the south dead end or the east pit - the archive
  taught WHERE to go - but it never gets in.
* Ducked-hull free space by core.trace: the tunnel entrance (x 592-640) has its floor at z ~3,698,
  80 u above the spawn floor (3,616-3,618); a thin shelf at the same height runs along the mouth's
  north side (y ~-2,878..-2,895, x 652-700+). The best jump (duck-jump) lifts the feet ~63 u. So
  from a standstill on the spawn floor the tunnel is out of reach: it is entered from ABOVE
  (falling onto the shelf / into the mouth) - energy again, or a lucky line.
* In both GE archives the tunnel was entered exactly twice (in 3.8M + 0.9M runs), from airborne
  parents at the mouth with h ~3,726-3,740 (bursts of 1.9-4.8 s), and once from the SOUTH passage
  (466, -2,983, 3,692) into the tunnel at (440, -2,933, 3,708): the field's south route joins the
  tunnel further west, it is not a dead end in topology - only for a slow walker.
  1,024 simple jump/duck/forward macros from the policy's own mouth states and 2,048 x 400-tick
  random bursts from the GE parent state: 0 entries. A rare event for uniform actions and for PPO.
* So both gates are energy gates. Next arm: per-call energy shaping (`--energy-pot-front 0
  --energy-pot-front-bonus 0`, K = 3: pays every gain of h, charges every loss), resumed from
  gewarm2 at 400M with both archives (pbr1b1_geen).

### The start room, solved in the simulator (2026-10-23 ~16:10 UTC)
* The wall west of the spawn (x ~620-660) has two gaps (north y ~-2,902..-2,916, south
  y ~-3,100), both with floors at z ~3,698 (80 u above the spawn floor) into a room (floor 3,666,
  ceiling ~3,778) that leads to the tunnel. Between them sits the doorway's func_conveyor plates
  (upper plate top ~3,678-3,681) inside a 2,500 u/s push-down trigger.
* The way in (found by `tools/entry_search.py`, random bursts with 95% repeat): (1) a duck-jump
  from the spawn floor that lands on the NORTH CORNER of the upper conveyor plate (feet ~3,678;
  the duck-jump peaks at ~3,679 - about 1 u of margin) - ~1 in 3,000 bursts from the true spawn;
  (2) from the plate, a jump + duck into the north gap, then crawl west ducked - from 1 in 400 to
  1 in 10,000 bursts depending on the landing. One burst in ~50,000 does both from the GE parent.
  No pump needed: this is a precision puzzle, not an energy one.
* Box run: 24 spawn->plate lines (81,920 bursts, 2.5 min) and 71 plate->tunnel lines (548,864
  bursts, 3 min) = 71 full spawn->tunnel lines, 270-552 ticks each.
  $AR_HOME/runs/pbr1b1/_entry/: stageA.npz, stageB.npz, full_lines.npz, entry_ge_states.npy
  (every 9th tick of the 71 lines = 3,361 states + the 4,038 GE forward states; md5
  3d014fb2abc6d883fd51b839611889b6).
* pbr1b1_geen (per-call energy shaping, resumed from gewarm2 at 400M): no pumping emerged in
  227M steps (episode energy +900/-1,000 u), greedy line still at the mouth (0.411-0.419), and
  the yaw head's sigma hit its 2.718 cap - a stuck warm policy loses its view precision. Stopped.
* Next: pbr1b1_entry = the stripped sidistic weights (fresh) + recipe + `--spawn-states
  entry_ge_states.npy --spawn-states-frac 0.4`: a dense curriculum along the machine-found entry.

### The entry curriculum, and why the stuck runs rot (2026-10-23 ~17:00 UTC)
* pbr1b1_entry (fresh stripped sidistic weights + recipe + 40% spawns from entry_ge_states.npy):
  the greedy line learned the first precision step - at 151M every episode duck-jumps
  continuously (jump ~95%, duck ~85% of ticks) with the feet peaking exactly at the plate
  (3,679), and one episode per eval at 151M / 227M / 302M LANDED on the conveyor plate - but none
  made the plate -> gap jump; scores 0.36-0.42.
* pbr1b1_entry2 (continued at 400M with the plate->tunnel step weighted 3x): evals 0.440 /
  0.343 / 0.258 / 0.166 at 400/476/551/627M while the YAW sigma climbed 0.54 -> 2.1 -> 2.6
  (clamp 2.718). The same rot in geen (sigma at the clamp, evals flat) and gewarm2 (0.08 ->
  1.06). Cause: the view sigma is one state-independent parameter and the entropy bonus pushes
  log sigma up by the coefficient every update while the advantages carry no signal (a stuck
  start room); the eval is greedy, but the policy is TRAINED on near-random yaw and its mean
  drifts. Same story as the pitch head (--pitch-entropy 0 under --view-absolute).
* `--yaw-entropy Y` (new, default 1.0 bit-identical, TRAIN_ONLY): Y = 0 drops the yaw head's
  entropy term; exploration stays with --unstuck's sampling temperature. Test:
  tests/python/test_yaw_entropy.py. Arm pbr1b1_yaw0 = pbr1b1_entry's launch + --yaw-entropy 0.
* Random bursts from the archive's 12 highest-energy pit states (h ~3,655-3,667) never reach
  d < 54,800 (4.1%) in 104k bursts, nor with their speed scaled x1.5 / x2 / x2.5 (h up to
  ~5,400): gate 2 is a directed U-turn climb (skill), not a lack of energy alone.
* pbr1b1_yaw0 (--yaw-entropy 0): yaw sigma holds 0.069-0.074 through 290M (vs 0.08 -> 0.5+ before);
  151M eval 3/9 episodes land on the plate (entry: 1/9), score 0.443; 227M 0/9 (feet max 3,721).
* WHY the second jump fails - the view at LOW SPEED: on the plate the eval's yaw swings ~160 deg
  every 20 ticks (near the 10 deg/tick ceiling). src/env.c view_mode 1: below 100 u/s the yaw
  command is a per-tick DELTA from the current yaw (base = yaw), above it an OFFSET from the
  velocity heading. The sidistic weights output offsets (tens of degrees) learned at speed; at
  plate speed they become near-max spins, so the keys push in random directions and the jump
  into the gap is never aimed. The start room is all < 100 u/s precision; PPO has to learn a
  low-speed yaw mode from plate experience.
* pbr1b1_yaw0b (yaw0 continued at 400M with the plate->tunnel step weighted 3x): plate landings
  3/9 (400M) -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 (702M), the view still spins at 10 deg/tick on the plate, no
  tunnel entry, 0.40-0.45. Stopped.
* pbr1b1_scr (the recipe FROM SCRATCH + the same curriculum + --yaw-entropy 0): yaw sigma
  0.31 -> 2.718 (clamp) by 270M ANYWAY, pitch at its 0.5 cap, kl 0.28: from scratch the policy
  gradient itself widens the view, so --yaw-entropy 0 only stops the bonus-driven part (the warm
  yaw0 run held 0.07). Evals 0.41-0.45, 0 plate landings. Stopped at 270M.
* pbr1b1_sil2: stripped sidistic weights with the YAW MEAN head zeroed (view_head row 0 and its
  bias: u = 0 = look along the velocity at speed, no turn below 100 u/s; the policy's surf trunk
  and keys untouched; _ckpts/sidwarm_yaw0head.pt, md5 a0438d24ebf21f53fc7a27beaa083a99) + the
  plate-weighted curriculum (entry2_states.npy, 40%) + --yaw-entropy 0 + self-imitation
  (--sil-coef 0.5 --sil-top 64: a rare tunnel entry stays in the buffer ~780 iterations) +
  --front-temp 0 (the trainer refuses front-temp with SIL). First eval: the view turns
  0.01 deg/tick at low speed (no spin).
* pbr1b1_sil2 (zeroed yaw head + plate curriculum + --sil-coef 0.5 --sil-top 64): the greedy
  line COLLAPSED - 123 u (76M) -> 7 u (151M) -> 8 u (227M), dying at the spawn; the SIL loss
  grew 5 -> 12.9 and the yaw sigma crept 0.078 -> 0.34. Stopped. (pbr1b1_yaw0c, a filler
  continuation of yaw0 on the original curriculum, ran 18:28-18:33 while I built the next arm.)
* `--demo-success-d M` (new, flag off bit-identical, tests/python/test_demo_success_d.py): the
  Salimans-Chen curriculum (DemoCurriculum) only counted FINISHES, so a spine ending in a hard
  room could never advance; with M a spine episode also succeeds when its ratchet record reaches
  d(spine end) + M on the shaping field.
* pbr1b1_bcur5: zeroed-yaw-head warm weights + `--demo-file spine_short.npy` (the shortest
  spawn->plate->tunnel line, 270 states, _entry/spine_short.npy md5
  b6e295f63250b43d1de8e3bc7fdce3ac) `--demo-window 10 --demo-grow 10 --demo-front-frac 0.67
  --demo-success-d -50` (success = record d <= 56,787, 50 u inside the tunnel) + --yaw-entropy 0.
  The curriculum refuses --respawn-novel / -backward-mix / -front-perturb / -greedy (and
  --int-real-only needs novel), so those are 0 for this arm: 90% of spawns come from the spine.
