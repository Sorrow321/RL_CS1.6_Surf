# r1b1 analysis scripts (ANALYSIS ONLY - never training; CLAUDE.md sections 0 / 0b)

Both run ON THE BOX from /root/RL_Surf (copy the .py files and the .npy there), the box idle
(record_ckpt is CPU-bound: ~2 min for 20 episodes idle, ~4 min for 3 beside a trainer).

* `sid_cp2_nudge_sweep.py <ckpt> <out_dir> [ticks] [holds]` - WON'T vs CAN'T at the CP2 pit:
  one greedy episode per (tick, hold, nudge) through `record_ckpt.py --nudge-*`, scored on the
  goal field. Result on the wall checkpoint (905M): no short yaw deviation crosses.
* `sid_corridor_bench.py <ckpt> <tag> [n_stoch] [n_greedy] [states.npy]` - start the policy
  in the corridor under kill plate *45 moving east (its OWN frontier states moved there, the
  way --respawn-novel moves them; `sid_corridor_east.npy` both lanes, `_py.npy` the +y lane)
  and report how far east it gets, whether it reaches the ramp (x > 5,300) and how far west
  it comes back (`xret`). Map coordinates are measurement boxes only.
* `sid_r1_incumbent_traj_4916772864.jsonl` - the round-1 incumbent's own best greedy eval
  (r1b1_ratnovx2 at 4,917M, 9 episodes from the true start, best 28.63%): the root source for
  `tools/frontier_archive.py` on a box (the policy's OWN states, not a demo).
